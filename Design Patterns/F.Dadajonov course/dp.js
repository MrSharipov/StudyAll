******* Simple Factory DP in OOP ******

- The factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a generic interface for creating objects. In the factory pattern, we can specify the type of object being created and we do not need to explicitly require a constructor.

- Object/Classses should be open for extension, but close for modificstion (SOLID)
